            <h1>Networking Overview</h1>
            <div class="info-section">
                <h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>A network is a group of interconnected computers and devices that can share information with each other. 
 Networks can range in size from two devices up to the largest network in the world, the internet.</p>          
                 <div class="feature-list">
                <h2>Networking Components</h2>         
<p>Multiple components are required to set up and configure a network. These components include:</p>                
                  <ul>
<li><b>Devices-</b> Devices can include a computer, tablet, mobile phone, gaming console, IoT device, and server. The devices are typically referred to as network nodes or hosts.</li>
<li><b>Transmission medium -</b> The transmission medium connects network devices. Examples include twisted pair cabling, fiber optics, and wireless radio signals.</li>
<li><b>Network interface (NIC) -</b>The network interface converts the digital data into a signal that can be transmitted along the transmission medium. </li>
<li>You can use domains to manage computers within the domain network. Changes made in the domain are automatically applied to all computers within the domain.</li>
<li>Specialized devices are used to connect host devices together. These connection devices include: 
<ul>
 <li>Routers to connect multiple networks together.</li>
 <li>Switches to connect multiple computers inside of a network together.</li>
 <li>Access point to connect wireless network hosts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Networking protocols -</b> These are standards that define how data is formatted and how the network hosts will talk to each other.</li>
 </ul>
       <h2>Network addressing</h2>
<p>Every device on a network requires a unique address. 
 The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) formats the unique 
 address using four octets that are each separated by a period. 
 The IPv4 address is split into two components:</p>             
                  <ul>
<li>The network ID defines the network address. Every host on the device has the same network ID.</li>
<li>The host ID is a unique value that is different for each device.</li>
                  </ul>
<p>The subnet mask defines the octets that belong to the network ID and the octets that belong to the host ID.
 The standard subnet mask consists of four octets that match to each octet in the IPv4 address.
 Each octet in the subnet mask consists of two values, usually 255 or 0, but not always. 
 Octets with 255 represent the network ID and 0â€™s represents the host ID. For example:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The IP address 192.168.0.5 with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 shows that the first two octets in the IP address are the network ID and the last two octets are the host ID.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Often, a large network is split into smaller networks called subnets.
 The subnet mask defines which network a host belongs to. 
 Two devices need to be on the same subnet to communicate. 
 If they are on different subnets, the traffic has to be sent through a router which will forward it onto the other network.</p>
                  
                 <h2>Networking benefits</h2>
<p>Despite the costs of implementation and maintenance, networks save organizations money by allowing them to:</p>        
 <ul>
<li>Consolidate (centralize) data storage.</li>
<li>Share peripheral devices such as printers.</li>
<li>Increase internal and external communications.</li>
<li>Increase productivity and collaboration.</li>
<li>Provide a centralized management location for user accounts and security.</li>
<li>Allow a network technician to remotely troubleshoot issues.</li>
 </ul>
                  
<h2>Network types</h2>
<p>There are several ways to classify networks. The following table describes several of these ways.</p>       
<h3>Host role(peer-to-peer)</h3>
   <p>In a peer-to-peer network, each host can provide network resources to other hosts or access resources located on other hosts. 
    Each host controls access to the resources located on it.
</p>
<h3>Host role(client-service)</h3>
   <p>In a client-server network, hosts have specific roles. For example, some hosts are assigned server roles, which allow them to provide network resources to other hosts.
    Other hosts are assigned client roles, which allow them to consume network resources.</p>
<h3>Host role(client-service)</h3>
<h2>Geography</h2>
  <h3>Body area network (BAN)	</h3>
     <p>A body area network is a very small network that consists of wearable or implanted devices such as a smart watch, fitness trackers, or medical implants.
</p>

   <h3>Personal area network (PAN)	</h3>
      <p><i>A personal area network is a very small network used for communication between personal devices.</i>

       <br>
For example, a PAN may include a pair of wireless earbuds and a smartphone. A PAN is limited to a few feet in range. A PAN is typically created using Bluetooth wireless technologies.</p>
  <h3>Local area network (LAN)	</h3>
       <p>A local area network is a network in a small geographic area, like an office. A LAN typically uses wires to connect systems together.</p>

<h3>Metropolitan area network (MAN)	</h3>
<p>A metropolitan area network is a network that covers an area as small as a few city blocks to as large as an entire metropolitan city. MANs are typically owned and managed by a city as a public utility.
<br>
Be aware that many IT professionals do not differentiate between a wide area network and a MAN, because both use most of the same network technologies.</p>
